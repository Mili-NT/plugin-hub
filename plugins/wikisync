warning=Similar to the official HiScores, this plugin pushes up data about your character that can be viewed by anyone.<br>We don't suggest using this if you are (for example) a PvP-locked hardcore ironman, where broadcasting your<br>quest status could be detrimental to your account by giving away information about what you're currently doing.
